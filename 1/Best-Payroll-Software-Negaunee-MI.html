Consider how you or your staff will be taking payments from your customers. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants.</p>

You can take orders, manage tables and reservations, split checks, and accept payments with it. It manages inventory at the ingredient level, and its purchase-ordering system can automatically reorder supplies.</p>

One thing to watch out for is that sometimes these features are included in the basic monthly software fee while other times they need to be purchased, upping the price.

<p>Choosing retail POS software that is cloud-based, as opposed to a local server-based, can save you money too. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on the visitor's computer or mobile device. Retail stores require different types of POS equipment.

<p>If it happens to crash and you don't have a backup, then you risk losing all your data, not just sales, but profit and loss statements and payroll statements. You can serve customers faster with good pos equipment that uses touch screen technology to streamline the service process. Some stores use a single, much longer but faster-moving line, that is served by multiple registers, which produces the same average wait time, but reduces the frustration and variance in wait time from person to person.</p>
