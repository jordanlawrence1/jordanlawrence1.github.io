<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>Intuitive inventory management and ordering tools save time and money, while dynamic scheduling tools help you ensure you have the right amount of staff in-house at all times. One cool benefit of POS software is that it can build individual profiles of all your customers and track their purchase history and shopping habits. They go above and beyond payment processing by automating all the critical management tasks, hence streamlining business operations as well as communication.</p>
<p>Reporting is also a paramount consideration, so when it comes to selecting a retail management software, you'll want customized reporting with detailed customer reporting, sales reports, vendor reporting, and inventory stock levels. POS systems let retailers track their inventory across multiple stores in different locations. The company should have references, provide after-hours technical support, provide warranty protection, assist with incorporating the system in the business, and are up-to-date on software and new features.</p>

<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it.
