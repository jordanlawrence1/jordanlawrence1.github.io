<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations.

<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window.

Manage multiple warehouses- move stock between different businesses with the stock management system. Through the tablet's interface, customers can pay bills, sign receipts, and even offer tips for convenient cashless and paperless transactions.</p>
<p>But restaurant POS systems these days do much more than accept payments: They track inventory; text and email receipts; analyze customer and sales data; do invoicing; and help manage employees, among other capabilities. The POS includes a payment system, online ordering platforms, accounting systems an CRM. All of this data can help businesses to maximize profits and eliminate waste. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>

<p>Small bars typically benefit from cloud-based POS software offered on a month-to-month basis.

But I had breakfast with a group of retailers and I asked them what kind of retail software point of sale (POS) systems they were using.
