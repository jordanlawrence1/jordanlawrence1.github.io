<p>Before choosing from the many great POS systems for restaurants and bars , evaluate your business's needs and assess how each option fulfills those needs. A POS transaction is the moment where a transaction is finalized or the moment where a customer tenders payment in exchange for goods and services. With customer resource management (CRM) solutions, restaurateurs can use customer data to deploy email marketing and influence loyalty programs, and online ordering.</p>
<p>A point of sale system can help you retain your customers by storing customer data and purchase history. Keep customers coming back with seamless shopping experiences both in store and online.

But no matter how well prepared the menu, or how engaging and talented the staff, there needs to be a solid business infrastructure in place.</p>
<p>Our POS comes standard with features which will improve your entire business, without the hidden cost. Build Recipes: make recipes and get information about their nutritional value to prepare excellent menus and manage your food costs well. The only negative to implementing a new restaurant management system is the training time and challenge of learning new software. The features are most comprehensive for inventory and vendor management.</p>

Instead, let us sort through the crud and recommend the right POS systems for small businesses. So, while your sales associate is looking up stock availability from Retail Pro on an iPad or iPod Touch (or any other mobile device), they can also look up the customer's transaction history and make recommendations for cool sweaters or tees to complete their look.</p>
<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
