Considering all that, it's not hard to see why pos terminals can be found in restaurants, hotels, bars, shops, stores, malls. With customer relationship management, maintain customer loyalty programs, issue gift cards, maintain customer data and add comments and notes.

Some restaurants are adopting a customer-facing POS with tabletop devices providing upsells and remote service.</p>
<p>A POS system also frees your staff from many time consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the most important job at hand - customer service.
