<p>The early days of using a cash register and pen and notebook for accounting and processing transactions are no longer an effective means of keeping up with today's advancements in business technology. On the subject of transactions, Vend gives your customers the option of putting their favorite items on layaway or to pay for their goods via a split payment or credit they've accumulated on their customer account.
