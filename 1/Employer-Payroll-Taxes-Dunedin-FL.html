<p>Many systems also feature add-on modules such as payroll time clocks and customer preference databases. Easier payment options : When payments of the checks are as easy as swiping or tapping a card, not only do the staffs not have to worry about keeping tab over the patrons upon serving the checks but also ensure that the patrons enjoy a hassle-free check-out after a night's merriment. The best restaurant POS systems are also cost-effective, well reviewed, easy to use, and come with a professional customer support team.</p>
<p>You mention how a point of sale is the most important place for customers to visit since it is the place the customer can go. I always thought the point of sale was more of a phase in the shopping experience but explain how it simply means it is where the customer pays for the goods or services provided.
