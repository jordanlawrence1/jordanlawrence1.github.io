Now you can manage all your orders from the preferred food delivery companies like Zomato, Foodpanda, Swiggy, and UberEats with our eZee Optimus - an online restaurant POS system.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.
