<p>The "point of sale" in any retail store, restaurant, grocery store, and so on refers to the location where transactions typically occur (i.e. check-out). But just because you have someone on the phone doesn't mean your system is back online; you're still losing revenue every time an impatient customer walks out of the store. All function essentially as sales and cash management tools, but each has features that are unique. In essence, they are built to help you with inventory management, order management, customer management, table management, credit card processing, menu management, employee management, and remote real-time tracking of all the KPIs plus cash flow.</p>

There are hundreds of different POS systems on the market, with the most popular being Mobile and iPad POS.</p>
