<p>Restaurant POS, or point of sale system, combines software and hardware for centralizing a restaurant's business operations. A POS system for your restaurant and bar will help you retain the money you earn. If a restaurant offers gift cards, POS software offers an easy way to redeem them and adjust the check. Then when it comes to payment processing, Square for restaurants proves to be quite a flexible solution. This is a suitable point-of-sale option if you do not manage a lot of inventory and you need to be mobile. Besides, nowadays, most of the barcode scanner may also integrate with Inventory Management system to change stock levels automatically and efficiently.</p>
<p>Not all retailers have the same inventory needs or offer the same services to customers. You may think of this as a mobile register that may be moved to wherever the customers are, only that it offers more capabilities than a conventional cash register. More retailers today are recognizing value in the raw data they collect from every transaction and seeing the need to use it more strategically to create a unique customer experience that will boost their bottom line and keep customers coming back for more.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard restaurant-centric features, it offers many useful features specific to bars. Refunds and store credit can be offered and Shopify allows for pretty much any payment option you can think of. Imonggo is a retail POS system with a free plan for startups and very small businesses, specifically those with fewer than 1,000 inventory items that sell 1,000 products or fewer per month. Besides just cash registers, when people are discussing POS systems, they're referring to the software itself, which can be cloud-based or client-based.</p>

Manage one or multiple locations anytime, anywhere, through Revel's central management console.</p>

<p>You may, for example, not need a cash drawer if the majority of sales are through card. Mobile POS systems allow employees to mingle with your customers on the store floor, deterring shoplifting. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business.</p>
<p>For retail stores that might want to venture out into selling on the internet, a retail point of sale system will prove to be most beneficial. Our newest product, POSIM EVO, has revolutionized point of sale technology by making available a cross-platform software suite with touch screen capabilities. Vend Pro offers added features like advanced analytics and reporting, gift cards, promotions, ecommerce channels, multi-outlet retail management, and API access.</p>

Bottom Line: Paying with your iPhone via the Apple Pay mobile-payment system is a convenient and secure experience, but for now it's not possible all that often.</p>
<p>Although Vend is our choice as the best retail POS system, it is important to research other POS systems for yourself to see what system is the best option for your business.
