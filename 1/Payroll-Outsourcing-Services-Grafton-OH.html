<p>There are many kinds of payment processing solutions available to use such as new mobile payment methods and credit card readers, however, the POS systems we reviewed for this article are full-on cash registers. Each system is made to provide the most efficient and productive POS experience for you and your customers. In an effort to make retailers' lives easier, mobile POS system providers started taking payment processing in-house, officially removing complicated (and potentially risky ) third-party payment processors from the equation.</p>

Integrated with your electronic point of sale or cash register system, you can have inventory software that automatically updates the stock count for each item as orders arrive and staff register the sales.</p>

<p>When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. The software comes with a powerful API, a key tool that offers retailers the freedom to integrate existing systems to achieve centralized management. The vital purpose of any such system is to keep the business data organized, well-managed and maximize profit and the POS knowledge will help your staff to work efficiently and enhanced productivity.</p>

But like retail sales training, don't see the purchase as a cost but as an investment. It provides recipe management and food costing, purchase management, stock management and inventory, along with a powerful reporting capability.</p>
<p>For store-owners in any business, it is important to maintain a cash counter for payment purposes. But, make no mistake about it. A restaurant POS system doesn't come in the form of a software application only. POS systems can suffer from internet connectivity problems and software issues. Modern POS speeds transaction times, and mobile POS adds a powerful line-busting tool to your arsenal. The intuitive and easy to use point of sale system works on mobile and desktop devices and being cloud-based, allows businesses to access key data whilst on the go.</p>
<p>It helps you manage restaurants, Mini Bar, Spa, Travel desk and many more. Square provides feedback through intelligent reports and analytics, giving you insights on your operations and a real-time situation on your sales, customers, and more. For instance, POS systems for the restaurant business can enhance customer loyalty and retention by being used for promotions via email or sms.

This POS software is suitable for nearly every type of store.</p>
<p>With it you can manage multiple store locations, send digital receipts, issue discounts, work offline, and accept credit card payments through an integration with credit card processor Vantiv (processing rates vary depending on your business). Besides quicker service, tableside makes settling bills easier for your customers. It's not all third-party integrations, of course: Within the software interface itself, ingredients can be tracked individually through the inventory management features, a floor plan display helps guide servers to the table they need when they need it, and a menu that supports photos of each meal to be included with each description.</p>
<p>Small bars typically benefit from cloud-based POS software offered on a month-to-month basis. Depending on the program, customers can store up points or earn rewards based on the amount of money they spend. But I had breakfast with a group of retailers and I asked them what kind of retail software point of sale (POS) systems they were using. It's targeted at restaurants, bars, breweries, cinemas, salons, and grocery stores.</p>
