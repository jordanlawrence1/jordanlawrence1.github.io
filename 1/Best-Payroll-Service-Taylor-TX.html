<p>When it comes to choosing the right Linux POS software for your business it is important that you know what the advantages and disadvantages are to be had from the Linux based ones. But if you've done any online searches for POS systems yourself, you've likely discovered something overwhelming: there's a staggering pile of POS solutions to choose from.

Catering: Using this restaurant management system, you can manage catering orders for wedding, office parties and other social gatherings.</p>

<p>Digital adoption — Silicon Valley is packed with early adopters who want all the options, but restaurants on the Rust Belt can stick to a more compact POS with fewer features.

Founded in 2004 in France, CLYO Systems creates payment and management solutions for restaurants, bars and cafés.</p>
<p>For example, it offers barcode scanners, employee management tools, sales tracking, and inventory management, at a basic or enterprise level. As in other software industries, many POS vendors have cloud-based SaaS (software as a service) plans that you subscribe to. These tend to be the most affordable options.
