Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>

POSGuys offers a wide range of products for retailers, restaurants and salons. The mobile POS can be used to serve customers everywhere - alternatively, there is a self-order menu that lets customers order by themselves on an iPad at their table.
