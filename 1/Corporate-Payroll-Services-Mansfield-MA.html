<p>Digital adoption — Silicon Valley is packed with early adopters who want all the options, but restaurants on the Rust Belt can stick to a more compact POS with fewer features.

Founded in 2004 in France, CLYO Systems creates payment and management solutions for restaurants, bars and cafés.</p>
<p>Proactive retailers are constantly striving to increase visibility into exactly who their customers are, how they're interacting with your stores, and what they want.
