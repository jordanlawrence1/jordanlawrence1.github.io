In fact, cash register in a retail store plays a vital role in keeping track of sales, inventory etc. Most point of sale companies offer retail POS system bundles that include essential hardware components in different variations. Restaurants with a healthy online customer base need a POS system like Clover, that can handle online orders and delivery management.

Tracking sales by items, department, and hours, plus costs for food, labor, and other expenses are some important KPIs needed.
