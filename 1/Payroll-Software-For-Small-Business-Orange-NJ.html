<p>Point of Sale (POS) Systems have now become the business management choice for most retailers when managing their day-to-day business activities. Retail and gaming POS solution that offers employee access controls, inventory tracking, check splitting, and loyalty cards. Our POS terminals speed up your daily operations and enhance your customer service by automatically calculating offers, promotion prices and special prices for loyal customers. TouchSystems understands that reality and helps people to discover those tools, whether they be self-service kiosks, digital signage or point of sale (POS) terminals.</p>
<p>Restaurant Point of Sale Systems do much more than the typical Restaurant POS Cash Register. With a handheld mPOS your customers do not need to line up and wait at the counter when they have to place an order. The customers were required to go to the cash register where their credit cards could be processed. A typical EPoS system in not capable of being all things to all men, so it's essential that it has the capacity to be integrated into other systems within the business.</p>
<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. It's a feature-rich POS that offers plenty of options that others systems don't always have, including a training mode, offline functionality, bill splitting options, online order management and tableside ordering, in addition to sales and inventory tracking.</p>
<h2>Human Capital Management Orange</h2>
<p>POS systems come with a wide variety of features and add-ons. One thing you should note though- while you comfortable adopt it in a single-location business, TouchBistro's POS system is predominantly ideal for restaurant businesses with multiple locations. However, varying POS locations can give retailers more opportunities to micro-market specific product categories and influence consumers at earlier points in the sales funnel.</p>

With the ability to track reservations and know which tables are reserved at the beginning of service, it becomes much easier to seat walk-in customers. It will help you manage your menu items, and even track your employee's time and hours worked.</p>
<p>A cloud-based POS system is a point of sale platform that stores information on the cloud. Retailers must adhere to specific standards when selecting POS systems, keeping in mind that the perfect marriage of POS with eCommerce is the key to running a successful retail business in the future. Better software systems allow for a variety of customer data and mailing capabilities which can identify customers by last purchase date, birthday, purchase history, customer type and salesperson.</p>
