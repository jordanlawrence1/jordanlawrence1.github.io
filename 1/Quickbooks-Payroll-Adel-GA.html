PHP Point of Sale can be used by retailers, grocery stores, bakeries, coffee shops and museums.</p>
<p>Our Point of Sale software serves as the central component for your business; it's the hub where everything - like sales, inventory and customer management merges. Life became easier for restaurant chains and multiple food outlet brands that needed to maintain consistency as well as their operations through the Central Kitchen Management feature. Customers can explore the pay-at-table options, while the restaurant becomes flexible to accept all card types with this software easily.</p>
<p>Moreover, POS and restaurant management solutions out there are a dime a dozen, and cherry-picking the best isn't that simple. A POS terminal is the device that the mobile POS software runs on. With TallySoft's POS software, TallySales, your pro shop will benefit from a proven solution that provides robust functionalities at an affordability that's right for your business. Customers habitually research products online before they ever step foot in your store.</p>

<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure.
