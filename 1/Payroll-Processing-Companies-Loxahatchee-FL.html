<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Check inventory on the fly, assist customers with purchase decisions, and complete transactions — at the counter or out on the sales floor. Square charges a minimal percentage for every tap, dip, or swipe (representing your customer's payment via credit card or mobile device) in your POS device (tablet or smartphone with Square magstripe reader or POS terminal with Square contactless reader). The potential for huge profits, additional sales and repeat customers are the overwhelming reasons to sell gift cards.</p>
