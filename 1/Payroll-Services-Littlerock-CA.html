<p>As consumer technology evolves and consumer behaviors change, mobile POS systems are increasingly focusing on evolving their omnichannel selling capabilities and blurring the lines between online and in-store retail. Point of sale (POS) system is the spot where your customer makes the payment for goods or services that are offered by your company.
