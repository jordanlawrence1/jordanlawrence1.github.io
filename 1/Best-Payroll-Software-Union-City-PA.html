<p>A point of sale system is a type of computer or specialized terminal that is used to instantly record a transaction. Loyverse is suited for retail stores, salons, restaurants and cafes. Inventory management is a key omnichannel challenge and accurate allocation and replenishment are critical to customer satisfaction. Some POS software providers have proprietary POS hardware that you're required to use, while some providers let you use third-party hardware components. POSitouch offers a premium software suite with the features and functionality to support restaurants of all sizes, from independent locations to the biggest national chains.</p>
<p>With offline mode, you still can place an order, add customers, print sales receipts and record all the transactions. Square also works as an item management app as well as a real-time inventory and sales tracker. Loyverse POS system will do all the job: taking orders, track inventory of drinks and food, employee management, comprehensive analytics, customers loyalty program, and a lot more. For a small to medium business owner, you may want to consider choosing a POS system that allows you to completely track and manage your inventory and helps you get to know your customers and what they prefer so you will know when and how much to reorder.</p>
<p>But if you're specifically opening a pizza shop, for example, there are POS systems built just for that with integrations that allow online ordering and delivery tracking. Another feature-rich free POS software is Linga , which is designed specifically for food service businesses. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales. In addition to a full setup with an iPad stand, receipt printer and cash drawer, it offers a mobile POS option for accepting payments at the table.</p>

<p>With each of these systems comes different hardware and capabilities from different brands, including hardware, software, and additional features. Future growth — As your total orders, order stations, or restaurant locations grow, the cost for your POS system will grow, even though the features it offers likely won't. POS is the setup you have in place for processing face-to-face payments from customers. If one of your bartenders is being trained for a management position, for example, and you want to provide her with access to your labor reports, you can do so without assigning a default permission to all of your bartenders.</p>
<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>
