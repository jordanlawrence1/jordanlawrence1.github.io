<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Mobility - mPOS allows you to be mobile” where you can accept orders and payments at a vendor show, or take orders on the floor of your restaurant or retail store. A retail business's point of sale largely defines a customer's shopping experience. The Restaurant Point of Sale software has come a long way from only billing to complete restaurant management. Certification can be obtained either from: a body accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (Comité français d'accréditation or COFRAC) or the software provider of the cash register system.</p>
<p>POS software is installed at the very place the main transaction occurs at a retail store. Talech has a large how-to library and experienced customer support to help most restaurants quickly get the essentials operational. Accept all major cards, contactless and mobile payments - including Samsung, Google and Apple Pay - in seconds. The software caters to quick-service and full-service establishments, with a configurable toolset for nightclubs, pizzerias, bars, and chains in the US. Users can turn to the huge Toast community to share or receive best practice tips.</p>

Every time a customer purchases something at your business, you have a POS transaction. Key features include floor management, table and inventory management and mobile ordering.</p>
<p>A POS system also frees your staff from many time consuming tasks, allowing them to concentrate on the most important job at hand - customer service.

<p>You may, for example, not need a cash drawer if the majority of sales are through card. Mobile POS systems allow employees to mingle with your customers on the store floor, deterring shoplifting. For example, you could ask customers questions such as "do you ever shop with us online?" or "would you be interested in a frequent shopper program?" Also, keep in mind that even if there are software packages designed specifically for your type of business, they may vary wildly and you still need to research the features to determine what'll work best for your business.</p>
<p>Prominent features include omnichannel delivery, integrated POS, cost control, kiosks, and yes, even kitchen management. As an example, for a small business with one POS machine, we estimate you'll pay around $1,250 for hardware and about $69 per month for a software subscription. While the word inventory may instill fear in many managers, most admit, it directly affects a restaurant making money. Repeat customers are the lifeblood of any retail business.</p>
<p>The system is accompanied by powerful hardware, including credit card readers, receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, and label printers, to name a few. The software window has several columns such as items bought, quantity of each item, sales taxes, total payable amount, amount tendered and balance for the customer. Square POS has become one of the most widely used point of sale systems out there—and for good reason.</p>

From ordering and managing inventory to processing transactions, managing customers and staff, the point of sale is the central hub that helps retailers grow their business.</p>
