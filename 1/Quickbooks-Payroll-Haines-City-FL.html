<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure. In restaurants, the ability to track ingredients in real-time and set automatic stock alerts is extremely useful, while, for retail establishments, some systems come with the ability to create your own purchase orders and track inventory across multiple locations.</p>
<p>When you open a restaurant, cafe or bar, you need a point-of-sale system to accept credit and debit payments. The software comes with a powerful API, a key tool that offers retailers the freedom to integrate existing systems to achieve centralized management. The vital purpose of any such system is to keep the business data organized, well-managed and maximize profit and the POS knowledge will help your staff to work efficiently and enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>It is hard to find a mechanical cash register today; the majority of POS systems are electronic, meaning they use an electronic cash register or computer system.

<p>But restaurant POS systems these days do much more than accept payments: They track inventory; text and email receipts; analyze customer and sales data; do invoicing; and help manage employees, among other capabilities. The POS includes a payment system, online ordering platforms, accounting systems an CRM. All of this data can help businesses to maximize profits and eliminate waste. It might happen when one of your customers wants to have a split bill and your sales staff needs to manually enter the purchase details for each customer into the system.</p>
