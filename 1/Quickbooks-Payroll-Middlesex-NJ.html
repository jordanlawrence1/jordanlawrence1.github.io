<p>Instead of the restaurant or bar owner paying the sales tax the customer is now paying the sales tax. Retailers must understand their best customers and architect an operation that attracts them and establishes a meaningful relationship between them and the brand. With custom menu programming, your restaurant POS system will be ready to use the day it arrives. Flexible menu management lets you set automatic happy hour pricing, quickly add new drinks, and easily remove drinks from the menu when inventory for that item is low.</p>
<p>Again, these exploits by hackers could only be made possible because payment cards were processed through the POS system allowing the malware to either intercept card data during processing or steal and transmit unencrypted card data that is stored in the system database. A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
