The POS systems control various activities in the restaurant. By combining the data from your POS and payment processing systems, you gain insights into your best-selling products and which items to push back. While there are several kinds of payment processing solutions available, including credit card readers and various new mobile payment methods, the POS systems we reviewed are full-on cash registers. Reliable bar software should also offer beverage service-specific features, such as being able to transfer tabs and split checks and run customer tabs.</p>
