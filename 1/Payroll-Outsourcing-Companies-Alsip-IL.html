<p>All the Point of Sale systems serves the purpose of keeping a close track of daily sales. Point of sale software modules easily allow credit card processing and are built to easily receive input from credit card swipers. Reducing the time it takes to get your customer's their food is critical and can even make up for less quality. Sales are the most important part of any business and so they come from customers, so POS systems should streamline the customer experience to make it as hassle free and pleasant as possible.</p>
<p>More than simply a way to take orders and ring up sales, a POS system gives you total control over every important operational aspect of your restaurant. This POS system gives the owner features like inventory and sales tracking, monitoring products, and menu items, and generating reports. Today we're using Retail Pro in 350 stores worldwide.

A POS system is actually a retail management system” since the software goes beyond just processing sales, offering other capabilities such as inventory management, employee management, customer management, a membership system, supplier records, bookkeeping, issuing of purchase orders, quotations and stock transfers, sales reporting, and more.</p>
<p>This specialty store needed a solution that is affordable, easy to use and with an integration between their Inventory and point of sale. This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>

Your Striven POS solution is a power feature rich platform, offering hardware retailers with one or 100 stores the most power industry designed solution on the market today. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations.</p>
<p>Menu pricing control is vitally important to have if your bar also serves food. AB POS is one of the top retail POS solutions that offer robust POS terminals, ecommerce gateways, and software apps. Retail software is great for clothing stores and furniture outlets, but they don't serve the restaurant industry as well.
