<p>If you run a retail store, you know that a point of sale system is essential, especially in food retailing, where large volumes of goods go through the check out. CAKE, from Sysco, built its POS to meet the demands of Quick & Full Service restaurants. Point of Sale software for restaurant provides with a secure and reliable restaurant solution. As a result, you should be able to easily manage and coordinate table service, customer orders, as well as table reservations. Multiple happy hour features, create customer tabs, pre-authorize credit cards, and employee management. Rather than paying a hefty monthly fee for bar POS software, this POS has streamlined base pricing.</p>
<p>If a restaurant operates from more than one location, it can maintain a centralized, POS enabled inventory management system instead of visiting every location in person to supervise. For newer, smaller businesses, you may not need advanced and expensive POS system reporting features. Access the details for every reservation in the calendar to check the date, time, and notes on customers' preferences or their pre-order.</p>
<p>Also, manage multiple locations, and offers multi-user staff logins for security, time and tip tracking. Some restaurant POS systems offer these features as an integrated part of their system, but many do not.

One thing you should note though- while you comfortable adopt it in a single-location business, TouchBistro's POS system is predominantly ideal for restaurant businesses with multiple locations.
