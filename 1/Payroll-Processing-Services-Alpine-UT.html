<p>From traditional to mobile, HP is reinventing the customer experience with technology solutions that empower employees and engage customers. Point-of-sale software has allowed businesses to create customer profiles that give them the ability to track the most popular products and determine what products they should market based on their customers' shopping preferences. A credit card is easily read by the machine and the sale immediately sent to be approved. The biggest change in point-of-sale over the past few years are the affordable options available for small, or even micro, businesses available.</p>
<p>There is usually a form of payment involved to complete the transaction, such as credit cards, cash, debit cards, EMV, and mobile payments. All in all, Lightspeed is considered a relatively simple POS system for restaurants. The real-time analytic sales data tool helps you make the right marketing decisions for your business. The system will allow the bartender(s) in your business to spend less time on the POS screen.</p>
<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. It's a feature-rich POS that offers plenty of options that others systems don't always have, including a training mode, offline functionality, bill splitting options, online order management and tableside ordering, in addition to sales and inventory tracking.</p>

This inconvenience is however offset by the fact that credit and debit card data is far less vulnerable to hackers, unlike when payment cards are processed through the POS system where security is contingent upon the actions taken by end-users and developers. While restaurant management software is intended to be more of an end-to-end solution, restaurant point of sale software can also contain many of the same features.</p>
