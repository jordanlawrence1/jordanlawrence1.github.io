    <meta name="description" content="Paycheck Company in Derwood Maryland - As like all tailor made software, a payroll software application would normally require user training before one can reap the benefits from it.

<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ).
