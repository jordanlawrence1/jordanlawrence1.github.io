<p>It's hard to envision a retail or point of sale (POS) environment that doesn't make use of touch technology. Manhattan Point of Sale is the next generation POS system for retail, helping retailers sell, fulfill, and engage anywhere. Bar menus change all the time, and your point of sale system should adapt to it. Whether you offer happy hour specials or a new food item on your menu, you want a system that can sync all the information. It is used to store Money, credit card receipts and other paperwork. The primary differences between Quick Service and Full Service POS systems can be found in the software and hardware specifications.</p>
<p>Entered items are displayed in the receipt window and are ready for payment by either taking cash or swiping a credit card at any time. As part of employee management, you will need to handle the payroll in your bar from time to time. By having a POS system in place, you can understand your customers better and boost your sales significantly. Take a variety of payments with the Square magstripe reader, offer customers digital receipts and track sales in real-time.</p>

Card payment starts by swiping the card - through MSR or a handheld device then taking customer's authorization for the specified amount.

Your Striven POS solution is a power feature rich platform, offering hardware retailers with one or 100 stores the most power industry designed solution on the market today. A supermarket with high traffic cannot afford a systemic failure, hence each point of sale station should not only be very robust both in terms of software, database and hardware specifications but also designed in such a way as to prevent causing a systemic failure - such as may happen through the use of a single central database for operations.</p>
