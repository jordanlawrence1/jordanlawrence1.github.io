Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems are still comprised of hardware and software components but include many new functions too. To help you minimize lost sales due to out of stocks, use replenishment capabilities in Retail Pro.
