<p>Point of sale systems are revolutionizing the retail and hospitality industry. Enable your retail employees with a modern web and cloud point of sale system to deliver excellent customer service everywhere in the store. Detailed sales reports can be printed by region and by store or groups of staff within stores. It's crucial for your POS system to integrate easily with inventory systems, payment processing platforms, loyalty programs, reservation systems, CRM systems, shift scheduling systems, and other such tech platforms.</p>
<p>Newer technology services on the market like cloud-based and hybrid point of sale solutions run on iPads and tablets where your data is synced and stored online and eliminates the need for an on-premise server like with legacy software and hardware. Focus POS systems are PCI-compliant; easy to use, install and maintain; and deliver return on investment by maximizing operational efficiency and minimizing costs.</p>
<p>The POS system is widely deployed by ecommerce stores and many brick-and-mortar stores. Everything is customized to your business based on the features, add-ons, and hardware that you need. Erply is cloud-hybrid POS software for retailers; it suits independent stores as well as large chains. It is easy for software sales people to confuse you along the way. After all, most of us don't think of food as being "inventory," and therefore don't see a logical connection between a UPC bar code number and a yogurt parfait.</p>

In addition, Lightspeed includes tools for inventory management, CRM and data analysis, and we have even developed our own payment processing system: Lightspeed Payments.</p>
<p>You can even manage your operations on-the-go with the Shopify POS mobile app. Some vendors provide restaurateurs with the option of buying a restaurant management system and a point-of-sale in an all-in-one solution.
