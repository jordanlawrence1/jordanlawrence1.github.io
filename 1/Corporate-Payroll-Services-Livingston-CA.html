<p>It is hard to find a mechanical cash register today; the majority of POS systems are electronic, meaning they use an electronic cash register or computer system.

It fulfills all our requirements and fits our budget, way more than I expected from a restaurant POS software.</p>
<p>As the sales of gift cards is increasing every year, your POS system must have the capability to manage those as well. Inventory Management : Restaurant POS software makes inventory management easier and more accurate.
