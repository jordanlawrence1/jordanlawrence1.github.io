<p>With each of these systems comes different hardware and capabilities from different brands, including hardware, software, and additional features. Future growth — As your total orders, order stations, or restaurant locations grow, the cost for your POS system will grow, even though the features it offers likely won't. POS is the setup you have in place for processing face-to-face payments from customers. If one of your bartenders is being trained for a management position, for example, and you want to provide her with access to your labor reports, you can do so without assigning a default permission to all of your bartenders.</p>

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>It has been proven that businesses that do not accept credit cards for purchases will have at least 60% less sales than similar business that accept credit cards. Example of a restaurant counter with touchscreen POS software by Lightspeed, connected receipt printer, card machine and cash drawer. It provides POS software and hardware, including mobile options. Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is leading the IoT revolution in retail systems, allowing for end-to-end inventory control, smooth tracking of goods through purchase, and eliminating the need for barcode scanners at the register.</p>
