<p>Choosing the right retail point of sale system and software is not a decision to take lightly. This software is popular among small retail businesses because of its clear, unlimited, and no-hidden charges plans. Lavu is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as an intelligent combination of cloud computing, wireless technologies, and a sleek touchscreen interface for restaurant. Consider how you or your staff will be taking payments from your customers. Let's take a moment to look at the different hardware and software specs as they apply to both Full Service and Quick Service Restaurants.</p>
<p>Organize menu items, categories, choice sets and modifiers to customize your restaurant POS to meet the needs and offerings of your restaurant. If you're choosing a POS system for the first time, start making a list of features you must have and talk to fellow business owners who are operating in a similar space. Union, a POS system designed for bars and restaurants, prides itself on being a fast system for busy businesses.</p>
<p>If you are already using a payment-processing service and want to stick with it, then you will want to look at POS systems which work with that system (usually called "integrated processing" since the outside company's payments are integrated into the POS). You want your POS system to be able to handle every method you might need including debit and credit cards, checks, and cash. Other Square features allow restaurants to send invoices, manage payroll and integrate with third-party applications such as QuickBooks, Xero and TaxJar.</p>

Bindo is another iPad POS system that boasts sophisticated—yet user-friendly—inventory management features. A slow and clunky bar POS system doesn't slow down your ability to hand customers their check; it also disenchants your staff and employee turnover rates are a significant problem for bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>Small restaurant businesses like cafes, pizzerias, nightclubs and bars can capitalize on the software's advanced menu creation and table mapping capabilities, while large franchises would be more interested in taking advantage of its real-time multi-location data syncing. Epos Now POS comes as a complete system used in the hospitality, including restaurants, and retail industries. For retail businesses, inventory is carefully monitored and set to automatically replenish diminished inventory.</p>
<p>The best POS systems do more than just process sales and accept payments. In order to open a customer tab, the bartender only needs to swipe the customer's card through the system.

Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system generates solid insights, which come handy when you're making critical business decisions.</p>
