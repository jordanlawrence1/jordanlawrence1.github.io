Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table.

There are hundreds of different POS systems on the market, with the most popular being Mobile and iPad POS.</p>
<p>Dinlr Waiter is a POS system for restaurants that runs on iPads and iPhones. Think of a POS system as the convergence point where a customer and a business make a deal.
