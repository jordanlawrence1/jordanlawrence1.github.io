<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Point of sale (POS) machine is an electronic system that provides business with capability to retain and analyze a wide variety of data on a continuous basis which also gives the transaction information associated with consumer purchasing detail. They can integrate with mobile devices and cloud services and satisfy the software and hardware requirements of users. Those of us of a certain age who worked in retail or food service may remember the days before modern point of sale (POS) systems.</p>
<p>For multi-channel retailers who sell online and in physical spaces, applications like Shopify POS and Vend meet the above criteria. Hence it is important to keep a credit card terminal in any retail store or restaurant. Built by an industry expert, Upserve is a POS system with everything needed for restaurant, nightclub, bar, or café management.
