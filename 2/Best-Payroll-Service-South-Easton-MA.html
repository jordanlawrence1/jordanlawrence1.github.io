Global inventory, cross-channel orders and customer profiles are completely visible in real-time so associates are equipped to deliver thoughtful, knowledge-based interactions with a personal touch.</p>
<p>For example, having your inventory data visibility across stores means when your store is out of stock on a particular product, sales associates can check its availability at other locations. The platform features tools for recipe management and costing, purchase management, stock management, and inventory.
