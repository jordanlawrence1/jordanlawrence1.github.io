<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>Our restaurant point of sale (POS) systems are also designed to support the highest level of customer service, allowing you to create the dining experiences that will delight customers and earn their loyalty. Their interface allows you to present detailed menu options with photos, descriptions, and prices so new staff can familiarize themselves with the food in a flash. Combined, the tools are particularly handy for streamlining the management of multiple restaurant locations.</p>
<p>FusionRestro includes accounting, billing, staff and payroll functions, inventory management, and customer information management. The user interface of Vision Store and Store Mobile is so robust, associates can execute a handful of requests in one easy, uninterrupted step: a purchase here, a return there, a loyalty card, a web order inquiry, a custom order — no problem. As much as customer engagement strategy differs between brands, one thing is consistent across the board: the POS is still the one thing that never fails to bring sales associate and customer together.</p>
