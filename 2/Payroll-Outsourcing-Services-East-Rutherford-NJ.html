<p>If you are planning on starting a new retail business, or run a retail business and wish to streamline your operation, a crucial component that should be factored into your business plans is a modern day point of sale system and more precisely the benefits a good POS system can offer to the running of your business. A right POS should also keep track of inventory at other branches and provide continuous insights on product sales. As point of sale systems evolved, they became more computerised, storing a product database on a computer server.
