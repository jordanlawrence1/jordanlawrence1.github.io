<p>With Shopify POS, you can manage all of your in-store and online selling in one place. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards. From its start as part of an initial purchase order, to its receipt in the store or warehouse, as it is transferred between locations, when it is counted and re-counted - and eventually as part of a sale from the POS.</p>
<p>Some POS systems focus on quick service, while others on full service. Customize the interface of our bar POS system with our flexible menu management options, giving you instant access to your most popular drinks.
