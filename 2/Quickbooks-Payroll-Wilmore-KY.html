<p>Either one of these will help brick and mortar retailers switch to an easier to use and more affordable POS. The advanced POS system runs from an iPad or desktop computer and can integrate with Lightspeed's own ecommerce platform, additional apps and add-ons to enhance the in-store service - and of course the backend analytics and management functions. However, with hundreds of POS systems on the market, sifting through them to find the best solution for your business is overwhelming.</p>
<p>The software lets you stay on top of purchase orders, keep tabs on vendor orders by product, organize multiple vendors in one place, as well as run reports to instantly see your best sellers, total sales, and total taxes. The company says that its POS system has more than 200 features, including table management, kitchen processes, dashboard reports and a built-in CRM.

A POS should have customer relationship management (CRM) to track all customer data. Vend POS checks most of the boxes small businesses are looking for when it comes to a point-of-sale solution.</p>
