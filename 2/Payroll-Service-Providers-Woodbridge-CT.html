<p>POSsible POS for the best performing segments in the broader food-services sector. They'd be happy to provide a list of free retail POS software recommendations that meet your exact requirements.

Once you look past the essential POS software requirements such as sales reporting, analytics, and inventory management, you'll want to inquire about additional features and services intended to support your growth.</p>
<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity. At the same time, a good POS system will allow you to accept cash, credit, and contactless payments and some will even let you accept online payments for your products and services.</p>
<p>Keep all the stores linked up by sharing customers, gift cards, stock and more. You need to make sure that the POS hardware - the scanners, computers, and printers - is compatible with the software you have chosen. POS hardware can be a stationary terminal or a mobile device, such as a tablet or iPad. For the cash register, the POS terminal is a computerized replacement that helps in processing credit and debit cards.</p>
