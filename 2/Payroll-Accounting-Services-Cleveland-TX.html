<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. The Lavu restaurant POS system can proceed with payment processing even in offline mode. But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business. Evolving from the bulky, complex cash register system to today's highly-portable, fits-in-your-pocket card readers, accepting payments has never been simpler.</p>
<p>These portable systems give you the flexibility to process payments right at the point of sale instead of making customers wait in line. If delivery is a significant portion of your business, you'll need a restaurant POS system that specializes in delivery management.

<p>This is only possible with a faster system of product delivery to the customers.
