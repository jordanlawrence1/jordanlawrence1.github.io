<p>Some are rather simple applications; others can manage complex inventory situations and employee time tracking.

<p>For example, many retailers use POS systems to manage membership programs that award points to frequent buyers and issue discounts on future purchases. POS systems record each time you check out a customer and automatically deduct the purchased item from your inventory list, which is maintained on the systems' hard drive. With the POS software, you don't need terminals, cash registers, barcode scanners, or receipt and label printers.</p>
<p>Ingeniously designed, Echo is for smaller do-it-yourself merchants that want something more robust than our free Casio cash register , but don't necessarily need the added features and functionality of our Elite free POS system. Toast streamlines both front and back-end processes, making it a restaurant management solution that is comprehensive and efficient. With Harbortouch's free POS program, we'd be remiss by not adding a retail point of sale system to our product line of software and hardware products.</p>
