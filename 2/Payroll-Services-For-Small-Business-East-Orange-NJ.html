<p>Now the last thing I want is for this be a shameless promotion of the software we develop. One of the first microprocessor-controlled cash register systems was built by William Brobeck and Associates in 1974, for McDonald's Restaurants 4 It used the Intel 8008 , a very early microprocessor (and forerunner to the Intel 8088 processor used in the original IBM Personal Computer ). Each station in the restaurant had its own device which displayed the entire order for a customer — for example, 2 Vanilla Shake, 1 Large Fries, 3 BigMac — using numeric keys and a button for every menu item.</p>
<p>With offline mode, you still can place an order, add customers, print sales receipts and record all the transactions. Square also works as an item management app as well as a real-time inventory and sales tracker. Loyverse POS system will do all the job: taking orders, track inventory of drinks and food, employee management, comprehensive analytics, customers loyalty program, and a lot more. For a small to medium business owner, you may want to consider choosing a POS system that allows you to completely track and manage your inventory and helps you get to know your customers and what they prefer so you will know when and how much to reorder.</p>
<p>Reduced time for management to compute employee hours. Remember that CardSmart Merchant Services has two additional point of sale systems, either of which would be an excellent choice. The PDT stores your inventory count which enables you to upload it quickly into your Point of Sale software.

Servers can not alter checks without a password, putting a stop to unapproved discounts for friends and family members, and eliminating the opportunity for theft. With most modern retail POS systems you can have instant access to sales and expense data from your stores during the business hours.</p>
<p>Avoid losing sales and increase customer satisfaction with a faster and more convenient checkout experience. Most popular restaurant POS systems offer a free trial or demo of their product.
