<p>Looking for a way of speeding up the check out process in your supermarket? Reports, data, work orders, employee management, customer profiles—Lightspeed's retail POS software helps you run your entire business with cloud-based tools that you can use to grow. Bottom Line: While Lightspeed Retail POS's UI can be a bit busy, it does provide all of the basic features needed for a solid point-of-sale (POS) system. A feature that every retail business owner loves from their POS systems is the reporting feature.</p>
<p>GiftLogic is Windows-based POS software for retailers. The sales module lets you tag your popular selling items for building a business. An often-overlooked capability of point of sale software is the ability of intelligent software to assist in promoting increased sales volumes. The availability of local processing power, local data storage, networking, and graphical user interface made it possible to develop flexible and highly functional POS systems.</p>
<p>First Data and ICICI Merchant Services combines a payment gateway and point-of-sale software and hardware solutions with features such as card & check acceptance, and merchant mobile commerce solutions, and ecommerce gateway. Another helpful option is setting up a few kiosks in your large retail store for your customers to look up pricing and product availability. POS systems now integrate more seamlessly with other back-end applications such as customer relationship management (CRM) and inventory management.</p>
<h2>Payroll & HR Solutions Exton</h2>
<p>Loyalty Programs — with the smartphone era, modern POS systems are implementing loyalty programs more than ever to keep customers engaged. If cashiers can spend less time focusing on the cash register and credit card processor, they can give your customers proper care and attention. Dashboards give you a bird's-eye look at important information, including sales, inventory, and revenue data. Consequently, the Upserve restaurant POS system comes with a range of decent features for helping hospitality professionals reduce their workloads, automate processes, and streamline their operations accordingly.</p>
<p>Loyalty and rewards programs will keep customers coming back time after time, and is a feature that retail POS systems can't handle. Square doubles as a credit card processor, so you won't need to integrate a third-party solution to accept payments. Logic F&B restaurant management software helps businesses in the food and beverage industry with daily operations, point of sale functions and kitchen processes (recipe management) for food courts, cafe, bars, ice cream parlors, quick service restaurants (QSR), etc.</p>

<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminal—it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it. Therefore, buying the POS hardware is the right decision, even if you comprise a few features to cut down the initial cost. The ShopKeep Restaurant POS system generates solid insights, which come handy when you're making critical business decisions.</p>
