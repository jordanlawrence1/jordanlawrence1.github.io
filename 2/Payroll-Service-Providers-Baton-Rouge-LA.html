<p>It may not seem so at first but pizza restaurants can be the most complex of the restaurants to manage from the software perspective. Our Acid best POS software for retail business is compatible with multi-inventory & multi- store management system. We offer a local server based point of sale system with the reliability of traditional systems and the cloud functions that every business needs. Consider what your business needs to run transactions, how your customers prefer to pay, and how much you are willing to spend. Instore is an all-in-one iPad POS system for restaurants, cafes, bakeries, delis, bars and retail businesses with one or multiple locations.</p>
<p>Our Restaurant Software are distributed on Cloud so data retrieval is real time. As the next-generation point-of-sale system, with cloud-based service, SaaS architecture, and bid data analysis, we help customers to achieve marketing, operations, management and all-round development of smart restaurants. When we started, we used to write all of our sales on a piece of paper, but soon we realised that we needed an efficient POS to automate our work.</p>
<p>While some retailers still use systems as described above, many are moving on to advanced cloud-based POS systems where data is stored online. Typical hardware needs for POS set-ups include: credit-card swipers, computer terminals, monitors, bar-code scanners, receipt printers, touchscreens, computer peripherals such as keyboards and mice, and cash-drawers. Retain old customers, earn new ones and increase sales by offering free meals.</p>

<p>With Shopify POS, you can manage all of your in-store and online selling in one place. Traditionally, POS systems were physical cash registers that accepted only cash, checks, and credit cards. From its start as part of an initial purchase order, to its receipt in the store or warehouse, as it is transferred between locations, when it is counted and re-counted - and eventually as part of a sale from the POS.</p>
<p>The module provides reports that save you time and enable you to gain the insights you need to make data-driven business decisions. RFID in POS can further allow for charging to a customer's card via smartphone before they leave the store. The SalesVu team will help you configure your kiosks and make your menu even more irresistible by adding enticing photos and tempt customers with up-selling and cross-selling prompts that encourage them to spend more.</p>

Having staff carrying around iPads can make your business look more professional and save time with customer queries but there is, obviously, a cost premium per device.</p>
<p>Point of Sale Security : Using restaurant POS software, all employees are accountable for any sales rung up on their personal ID. Servers can not alter checks without a password, putting a stop to unapproved discounts for friends and family members, and eliminating the opportunity for theft.

By offering tools that make it easy to give your customers what they're asking for, you're able to save servers time and provide five-star customer service.</p>
<p>A point of sale system, or POS, is the place where your customer makes a payment for products or services at your store. There is also a table management module, a sales reports module, and other features like top-tracking. Imagine restaurant POS systems that can tell which customers are in which seat at which table, and charge them for their food individually and automatically without a single credit card passing hands.</p>
<p>Industry-specific POS packages are available-for auto repair shops, beauty and nail salons, video rental stores, dry cleaners and more. We are proud to present a system which can be adapted for all types of catering including restaurants, bars, clubs, hotels and also for outside catering.
