<p>Choosing a Point of Sale System is not a simple task. Although improving the ergonomics is possible, a clean, fast-paced look may come at the expense of sacrificing functions that are often wanted by end-users such as discounts, access to commission earned screens, membership and loyalty schemes can involve looking at a different function of the POS to ensure the point of sale screen contains only what a cashier needs at their disposal to serve customers.</p>

You can start with the basic features, then add apps for advanced capabilities such as staff scheduling, customer management and loyalty programs, either from the start or as your business grows.</p>
<p>Credit and debit card preauthorization (or "preauth") allows bartenders to swipe a customer's credit card, securely save that information as their bar tab, and verify that the card is real and has a preconfigured amount of funds on it.
