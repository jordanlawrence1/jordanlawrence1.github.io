<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>We culled seven of the best POS systems depending on a restaurant's particular needs. Our POS software enables restaurateurs to improve the profitability of their business through faster and more accurate order processing, multiple integrated modules like customer interface, employee interface, and access to 100+ reports.
