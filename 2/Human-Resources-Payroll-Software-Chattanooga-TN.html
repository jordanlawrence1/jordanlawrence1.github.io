TouchBistro is one of the few restaurant POS systems that have not only perfected the basic POS functionalities, but also gone beyond them to offer exclusive, out-of-the-box extras.</p>
<p>Manages the inventory- The point of sale software maintains the business' inventory. With a good (POS) point of sale system, you can keep customers loyal, and keep them spending. It is a cost-effective restaurant billing software for small business , which is also user-friendly. A POS system's inventory management module must provide complete visibility and accountability at store level at all times.

POSsible POS QSR software is extremely reliable, easy to learn, and easy to use, so staff spends less time in front of the screen and more time with guests.

<p>The LS One retail POS system is fully platform-independent and can support any number of POS devices, whether stationary or mobile, to connect at the same time. The FoodEngine POS which has promised results for many restaurants comes in two licenses — Perpetual (both Annual and Monthly premiums) and SaaS (only Monthly Premium). You can process payments on your store's floor (especially useful for cutting down lines at the register during busy seasons), at an expo, or at an outdoor pop-up shop.</p>
<p>Lightspeed charges 2.6% + 10¢ for payment processing (the same rate as Square for Restaurants) but can also integrate with outside payment processors, which you might prefer to use if you can secure a better rate elsewhere. After ten years, ShopKeep continues offering small, quick service restaurants an easy user interface with great base features. Retailers have the option of using local, server-based POS software, which stores sales data onsite; however, the best programs are either app- or cloud-based SaaS solutions.</p>
<p>The sole purpose of any Point of Sale System setup by any store is to improve sales and profits by keeping track of all the products being sold or purchased at the retail store.

<p>The Revel POS is designed to be a full restaurant POS system, managing finance and accounting in addition to sales, inventory, and staff. In order to take payment from cards with a chip, your credit card reader will need to accept what is known as EMV payment —a global standard for chip-based debit and credit card transactions. Most restaurants that have iPad self-order menus include photos of the dishes so guests can easily choose what they want to order.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest issue facing restaurants is inventory management. With these extra features, you can streamline your reservation system, keep track of employee timesheets and evaluate sales performance, as well as keep records of customers' order histories and personal details. Manage multiple warehouses- move stock between different businesses with the stock management system. Through the tablet's interface, customers can pay bills, sign receipts, and even offer tips for convenient cashless and paperless transactions.</p>

Your software handles much more than the sale aspect of the transaction - retail management software is a more accurate description. POS packages frequently come with integrated accounting modules, including general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, purchasing, and inventory control systems.</p>
