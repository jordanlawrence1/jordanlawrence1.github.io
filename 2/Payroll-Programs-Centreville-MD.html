Retailers also have certain functionality that should be incorporated in the POS system, spanning from an inventory library to keep track of stock levels to hardware tools like a scale on the counter (for food priced according to weight), barcode scanner and a device for taking off alarm tags of liquor bottles or clothes.</p>
<p>This system is integrated with the restaurant's POS and can accurately predict what is in on-hand inventory, as well as forecasting the size of the next supply order.
