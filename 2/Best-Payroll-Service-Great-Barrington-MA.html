<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>The traditional restaurant Point Of Sale brought with itself the miracle of customer data. Rezku was founded in 2012 by veteran restaurant owner Paul Katsch to bring the best technology to the food and beverage service industry. Alongside menu management are the inventory tracking functions. Easily manage and help grow your business when you use a PayPal card reader with one of our POS partners.

Retail management software typically includes: Point of Sale (POS), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Sales Order Management, Inventory Management, Purchasing & Receiving, Reporting and data driven Dashboard applications. With the internet boom and consumers adopting smartphones at an explosive rate, a host of new POS functionalities and features have emerged to help independent retailers offer the connected, omnichannel shopping experience that consumers love.</p>

They are basic and you will need to purchase feature's separately to suit your business needs, and you will find that they will actually end up costing you much more then it's worth.</p>
<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. Besides register capabilities, Revel has a ton of additional features, such as ingredient-level inventory management, analytics and QuickBooks integration.
