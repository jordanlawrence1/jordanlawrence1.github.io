<p>All retail businesses need to use cash registers but more and more high street shops and stores are now turning away from the traditional designs and are switching to POS or, to give them their full name, Point Of Sale machines. We are offering this all-in-one restaurant system which includes the pos, printer, cash drawer, pole display and also barcode scanner together with jRestaurant POS. For merchants, unattended POS systems offer an effective strategy for managing rising labor costs, as they allow one cashier to monitor customers using multiple self-serve POS kiosks instead of ringing up orders at a single station. These systems are best suited for small businesses and entrepreneurs, small retail stores, pop-up shops, and quick-serve establishments.</p>
<p>Motivate customers to visit your bar again by rewarding them with bonus points using the loyalty program. Don't miss this opportunity to reach out to your customers with a timely delivery to build brand loyalty among your customers. Good inventory control means balancing the expectations of your customers and your bankers, so you have to avoid being either under or over stocked. It suits inventory-based retailers, customizing the way they conduct ecommerce.</p>
<p>With the launch of mobile payment particularly Android Pay and Apple Pay both in 2015, it is expected that because of its greater convenience coupled with good security features, this would eventually eclipse other types of payment services - including the use of payment terminals. Since 1990, we have aimed to give restaurants a competitive edge by providing simple, yet powerful restaurant management solutions, designed specifically for the industry.</p>
<h2>Finance & Accounting Services Taylors</h2>
<p>Firstly, CAKE caters to full-service and quick-service restaurants, pubs, bars, and other food businesses. Credit and debit card transactions are now more common than cash payments POS systems make card processing fast, easy, and secure. A quick glance at a shopper's purchase history (or all those customer details you've started collecting!) in Retail Pro can equip your sales associates with the information they need to determine what products your customer would find most interesting and relevant, and make the offer for an upsell when they're in the store.</p>
<p>Remote access allows business owners to view how sales are going even when they are not at the restaurant itself. Besides register capabilities, Revel has a ton of additional features, such as ingredient-level inventory management, analytics and QuickBooks integration. If you have an aging cash register or point of purchase system and would like a new modern retail or restaurant POS system that's both affordable and easy to use, then we would love to talk to you.</p>

<p>Small businesses can benefit from a suite of features housed in something as easy and portable as an iPad and accessible through the cloud, because flexibility can be crucial in the restaurant business. With the online payment gateway, restaurants can accept modern payment methods like Apple Pay. And just like Lightspeed, ShopKeep Restaurant POS is available via a web-based dashboard and an iOS app, which serves as the primary cash register.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most valuable way POS systems help you gain better control of your business is through their reporting features. One capability they'll look for is a unified commerce platform that allows them to offer customers a seamless shopping experience that spans in-person, online and mobile channels. Most POS systems allow you to set reminders when certain inventory stocks are running low. We provide with various types of POS application development including restaurants, bar, cafes, retail business and much more.</p>
<p>This high-end system helps restaurants improve and grow their business. In addition to monthly software costs, the hardware costs are a one-time fixed cost that starts at $799.

If you operate a business with multiple employees, your POS software can help you manage them even when you are not around.</p>
<p>This multipurpose system works for nightclubs, bars, full service, fast, and casual restaurants, as well as bakeries and food trucks. Our goal is to help you discover the future possibilities by providing a ton of value with absolutely no annoying or high-pressure sales tactics.

Moreover, the system can identify loyal customers and offer rewards using the data collected through credit or debit cards.

<p>See what's selling and what's not with detailed sales and inventory reports. Save time by integrating Kounta with your payment terminal, accounting software, staffing tools, loyalty programs, and more. A huge area of opportunity for restaurants and bars is accurately calculating variance (also known as shrinkage and loss) and lowering it. Bar inventory management software has up-to-date inventory. Like most of the leading bars and restaurants, you probably allow your customers to tip their servers.</p>
<p>The ETP Omni-channel POS software is integrated with an in-transaction CRM solution which creates a single view of the customer right from registration to billing to customer specific promotions to loyalty management. The POS features include cash management, table management, and delivery management. The POS system captures the details of the reason for the return, salesperson's name, and remarks. Mobile POS systems are Cloud-based and substantially cheaper (but may be leaner in terms of extras).</p>
<p>Vend tracks every sale in real time, which allows us to view overall sales throughout the day or week. As a case in point, some self-ordering systems not requiring staff assistance may not properly recognize a subsequent order from the same customer at a table. For large retail stores or chain of stores, none of the changes are done locally. A complete restaurant management system that begins with taking the guest order and ends with billing and tax reports.</p>
