Any business records sales, but a restaurant must also be able to accept reservations and know which orders were placed from which table. Our POS software help you to keep a track on your sales with ease and aplomb. Since the system works through handheld devices connected to a main POS server, potential errors and omissions in the manual order taking process of the traditional point of sale restaurant are eliminated.</p>
