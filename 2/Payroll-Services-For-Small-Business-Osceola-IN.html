But if you've done any online searches for POS systems yourself, you've likely discovered something overwhelming: there's a staggering pile of POS solutions to choose from.

Another feature-rich free POS software is Linga , which is designed specifically for food service businesses. This way, you're saving customers from disappointment and you're saving sales.
