<p>It is important that the choice of POS software is compatible with the choice of POS peripherals or hardwares. Whether you are an independent restaurant or a regional chain, Table Service, Quick Service, Fast Casual, Bar or Nightclub, the ZOOM Point of Sale (POS) system is a system that can adapt to your way of doing business. POS for Restaurants, Bars and Cafes. Most POS software will also communicate with inventory levels to keep everything in balance. Automatically and seamlessly syncs sales, payments, inventory, customer data, and payroll information to QuickBooks.</p>
<p>This method of inventory management is more effective than the limited system, and when combined with strong loss-prevention procedures can result in large cost reductions per month. Host Jon Taffer recently endorsed many of our award winning point of sale systems to help struggling bars and nightclubs improve their efficiency and profitability. After testing dozens of POS systems, we found TouchBistro to be a top-of-the-line EMV-compliant system that also integrates an end-to-end restaurant management system.</p>
<p>FusionRestro includes accounting, billing, staff and payroll functions, inventory management, and customer information management. The user interface of Vision Store and Store Mobile is so robust, associates can execute a handful of requests in one easy, uninterrupted step: a purchase here, a return there, a loyalty card, a web order inquiry, a custom order — no problem. As much as customer engagement strategy differs between brands, one thing is consistent across the board: the POS is still the one thing that never fails to bring sales associate and customer together.</p>
