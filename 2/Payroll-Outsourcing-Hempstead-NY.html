<p>Restaurant POS software offers point of sale solutions specifically for the restaurant and bar industries. All sorts of payments are accepted: cash, credit, debit, check, gift card, and store credit. Its Brink POS software is designed for quick-service and fast casual eateries, and its PixelPoint POS is for full-service restaurants. This software includes table management and reservation management features as well as social media integration so you can easily send a Facebook invite or post to Twitter.

<p>The order management system features an activity dashboard that provides weekly or monthly sales reports for stock managers. In fact, research shows that more than half (52 percent) of retailers are arming store associates with mobile technologyâ€”and another 26 percent plan to do the same. Tillpoint is the multi-award-winning POS & Restaurant Management System. Mobile POS is now available that keeps POS users from being tied down to a specific location in a store.</p>
<p>Point-of-sale systems are still comprised of hardware and software components but include many new functions too. To help you minimize lost sales due to out of stocks, use replenishment capabilities in Retail Pro. You can accept payments directly by swiping and inserting the customer's cards, scanning checks, and accepting gift cards right on your POS system. A POS system comprises both POS hardware and software. It's a proven fact that when customers open bar tabs, they spend more.</p>

Regardless of the food service type, the software dashboard makes operations easy for tracking and managing orders and billing.</p>
<p>For example, it offers barcode scanners, employee management tools, sales tracking, and inventory management, at a basic or enterprise level. As in other software industries, many POS vendors have cloud-based SaaS (software as a service) plans that you subscribe to. These tend to be the most affordable options.

<p>The high-quality pos software can provide several benefits to your business. Customers additionally get mobile payment options like Samsung Pay and Apple Pay. Taking customer payments is easy with Square's credit card readers and point-of-sale mobile app, which works with most Android and Apple devices; for example, many Square users run their businesses with iPads. This history means that ACE Retail has one of the longest list of POS features in the industry.</p>
<p>The number one reason customers get unhappy with a retail store is a long queue at the check-out. There are so many restaurants out there who offer the home delivery feature for their customers. Square POS also sells Square Stand, an iPad contactless and chip stand that allows contactless payments as well as chip cards, NFC and magstripe. A feature-rich POS software provides a huge range of capabilities such as billing and order processing, sales monitoring and reporting, inventory tracking, returns, analytics, mobile connectivity, customer data management, employee management, and loyalty programs.</p>
<p>The less time you need to spend on accounting and calculating your operational costs, the more time you have for greeting customers and improving your bar business in other areas.

Today's systems work with equal effectiveness for the cashier, the waiter (through great screen interactivity and intuitive interfaces) and the management (through better and timelier reporting).</p>
<p>If you are operating a business, chances are good that you will need a point-of-sale (POS) system to complete consumer purchase transactions - and bars are no exception. Your software handles much more than the sale aspect of the transaction - retail management software is a more accurate description. POS packages frequently come with integrated accounting modules, including general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payable, purchasing, and inventory control systems.</p>
