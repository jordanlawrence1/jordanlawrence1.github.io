<p>In addition, your POS system must be able to perform basic functions such as bar code scanning, payroll management, handling of cash and credit card transactions and integrate seamlessly with online shopping cart systems. This is also referred to as a credit card terminalâ€”it's what merchants use to accept credit and debit card payments. With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>

<p>Obviously, you need to consider the cost of the POS system (including the hardware and software). Utilizing features like inventory management will help you find where to cut food costs and to boost profit margins by using recipe costing. But, using a POS that is tailored to retail isn't wise because a restaurant is a completely different business with different needs. Manage multiple locations and sales channels in real time, from any compatible device, including products, customers, and staff.</p>
<p>If you bar code all of your merchandise than you can not only save time in checking customers out and implementing markdowns instantly, but also you can eliminate the problem of switched price tags. For example, restaurants, retail businesses, and grocery stores all have their specialties and that is why they need a POS system that meets their specific needs. With POS Software you will be able to capture complete transaction details at the point of sale, and transaction history and real-time database records are stored indefinitely so your data is always available for reporting and analysis.</p>
<p>While the features above are important to consider when picking out a POS for your restaurant, you should go beyond just the features. You can rely on the well-known QuickBooks customer support for after-sales assistance anytime no matter where you are coming from.
