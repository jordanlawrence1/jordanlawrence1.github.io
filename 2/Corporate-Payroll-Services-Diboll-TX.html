<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>GiftLogic is Windows-based POS software for retailers. The sales module lets you tag your popular selling items for building a business. An often-overlooked capability of point of sale software is the ability of intelligent software to assist in promoting increased sales volumes.
