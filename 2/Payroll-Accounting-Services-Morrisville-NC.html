<p>Point of sale or POS systems are a necessary and invaluable part of most businesses. Restaurants need the ability to securely sell, track and redeem gift card transactions without transaction fees. For example, some restaurants require that items selected by the customers be attended to and can only be placed by the waiter who has the password required to do so. This prevents fake orders - such as may be entered by playful kids - and subsequent dispute on the items ordered. Collecting information even before your guests walk in your restaurant will keep you better prepared for your staff pre-service.</p>
<p>Other businesses who launched pre-2000s have since adapted their software to evolving technology. Say hello to the new point of sale (POS), a dynamic, multifaceted touchpoint that meets your customers where and when they're ready with convenience and personalization.
