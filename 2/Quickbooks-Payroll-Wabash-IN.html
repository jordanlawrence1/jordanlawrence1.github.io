<p>A Point of Sale (POS) system is indispensable for any type of retail business. QuickBooksPOS is a point-of-sale software solution with features such as ring up sales and inventory tracking. The software helps you manage your inventory, customers, and staff, and it includes loyalty tools and a timeclock app. We know your business is all about repeat customers. TouchBistro's restaurant POS system features can accommodate small, mid-sized, and large restaurant businesses. PHP Point of Sale can be used by retailers, grocery stores, bakeries, coffee shops and museums.</p>
<p>The order management system features an activity dashboard that provides weekly or monthly sales reports for stock managers.

Tillpoint is the multi-award-winning POS & Restaurant Management System. Mobile POS is now available that keeps POS users from being tied down to a specific location in a store.</p>
<p>Most POS systems provide sales data to some degree. Despite the more advanced technology of a POS system as compared to a simple cash register, the POS system is still as vulnerable to employee theft through the sale window. It's a feature-rich POS that offers plenty of options that others systems don't always have, including a training mode, offline functionality, bill splitting options, online order management and tableside ordering, in addition to sales and inventory tracking.</p>

Founded in 2004 in France, CLYO Systems creates payment and management solutions for restaurants, bars and cafés.</p>
<p>Touch screen menus, remote ordering, staff supervision, automated billing, and organization of customer accounts are all possible with the restaurant point of sale software.
