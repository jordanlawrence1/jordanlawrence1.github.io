<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.

<p>Retail 4.0 is the way forward for points of sale systems. By installing a POS software and removing the old manual cash register a shop can save a lot of money and resolve common issues like shrinkage. Combing mobile tablets with an intuitive restaurant POS interface is just one way to accelerate speed of service - and keep guests happy - at quick-service and fast-casual enterprises.

<p>Additional register features to consider for nightclub and bar point of sale software is employee management, inventory management, customer loyalty, recipes, tab management, quick reorder rounds, and quick customer checkout. Typical restaurant POS software is able to create and print guest checks, print orders to kitchens and bars for preparation, process credit cards and other payment cards, and run reports.</p>
