<p>Choosing a POS, or point of sale, system seems as though it would be quite easy. For instance, while a restaurant is typically concerned about how the sale window functions, whether it has functionality such as for creating item buttons, for various discounts, for adding a service charge, for holding of receipts, for queuing, for table service as well as for takeaways, merging and splitting of a receipt, these capabilities may yet be insufficient for a spa or slimming center which would require in addition a scheduling window with historical records of customers' attendance and their special requirements.</p>
<p>Not all retailers have the same inventory needs or offer the same services to customers. You may think of this as a mobile register that may be moved to wherever the customers are, only that it offers more capabilities than a conventional cash register.
