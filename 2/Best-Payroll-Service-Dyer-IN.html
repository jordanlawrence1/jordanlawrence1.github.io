<p>When it comes to choosing the right Linux POS software for your business it is important that you know what the advantages and disadvantages are to be had from the Linux based ones. But if you've done any online searches for POS systems yourself, you've likely discovered something overwhelming: there's a staggering pile of POS solutions to choose from. In its most basic definition, a POS system is a combination of POS hardware and POS software to create a POS machine for processing a transaction and payment. Catering: Using this restaurant management system, you can manage catering orders for wedding, office parties and other social gatherings.</p>
<p>The traditional restaurant Point Of Sale brought with itself the miracle of customer data.

<p>Regarding the payments, mobile POS can accept all kinds of payment methods from contactless cards, EMV chip-enabled cards, and mobile NFC enabled cards. Pro shops, as well as any retail business will benefit from TallySales. Real-time reporting — the option to generate real-time business reports, based on product sales and inventory data, is one of the key features that every multi-store retailer needs. Bottom Line: ShopKeep offers the point-of-sale (POS) system features that most small businesses will want without overwhelming them; however, the cost of add-ons can add up.</p>
<p>You want to be sure that your POS system can handle all of these latest emerging systems, but you also need to know if that implementation will hinder or help your Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (aka PCI DSS)-compliance efforts or whether it will please or annoy your customers. While each of those establishments are classified as restaurants, they all have very different demands when it comes to choosing the right POS system for their specific needs.</p>
<p>Inventory management, stock management, security, and timekeeping are only a few of the activities that this software can indeed simplify.

You can start with the basic features, then add apps for advanced capabilities such as staff scheduling, customer management and loyalty programs, either from the start or as your business grows.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most valuable way POS systems help you gain better control of your business is through their reporting features.

While other POS systems on the market encourage you to use your own devices, Revel strongly recommends that you buy hardware directly from them for everything to go smoothly.</p>
