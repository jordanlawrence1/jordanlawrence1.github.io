<p>Like their printer counterpart an all-in-one POS system combines multiple technologies and integrates them into one housing to maximize value plus convenience to the end user. Your point of sale system should be able to manage your customer base, keep up with their buying habits, how often they visit, when was their last visit and what special occasions they have coming up. Your point of sale system then should be able to sort these into groups that should be sent mailers, coupons, invitations to special events or simply told that they are appreciated and asked to visit you again.</p>
<p>The Offline Mode will not let you process integrated payments, edit & remove current customer profiles, or to discard and park sales. Nightclub or bar POS software with preauthorization will also immediately tokenize and encrypt customer credit card information when it's swiped, so no sensitive information is stored on the device. We do custom Point of Sale software development and pin pad interfaces compatible with all third-party devices for intuitive, feature-rich payment systems and terminal appli development systems improve workflows and customer experiences with a wide selection of sought-after features, including security algorithms, customer engagement modules, and analytics engines, and much more.</p>
