<p>Run the world's best retail with Vend POS software + PayPal. The good news is you can always find a different restaurant POS solution, either as a standalone product, or bundled within a larger venue management kit with multiple attractive functionalities. The ETP Omni-channel Store provides your customers a seamless experience across all your stores, e-commerce sites and other touch points. We are hardware retailers who could not find a POS solution that completely met our needs, so we developed it ourselves.</p>
<p>The hardware of a POS system consists of the physical setup like cash register connected to a PC or server, or even a portable device such as a tablet or smartphone connected to a cloud-hosted system. The TouchBistro hardware setup is simple and low cost and the licensing fees are also cheap compared to the gigantic POS systems of yore. Hardware investments are minimal, and the system is cheaper to set up than most traditional bar POS systems because it is compatible with third-party POS equipment.</p>
<p>The need for special tax calculations arise when you sell an item in the restaurant where the tax is added onto the sale but the same item in the bar has the tax included. With Zomato Book, you get benefits and features commonly found in the higher prices POS systems. But, taking the time to do your homework on point of sale systems can really pay off. Pre-authorization feature works great for bar tabs and lets customers hold onto their credit cards while they party.</p>

They are basic and you will need to purchase feature's separately to suit your business needs, and you will find that they will actually end up costing you much more then it's worth.</p>
