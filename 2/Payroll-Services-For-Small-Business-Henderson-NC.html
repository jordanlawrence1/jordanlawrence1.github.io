<p>The time and attendance system is another crucial aspect of managing labor. The Lavu restaurant POS system can proceed with payment processing even in offline mode. But the POS has transformed physical retail, allowing SMBs and large corporations alike to gain new, deep insights into their business. This is why I recommend taking your time and assessing the various people you will rely on to make the software work for your business.

<p>POS is now commonly referred to as only the cash register feature within a retail management system. Safe, secure and fast payments: EPOS systems often come equipped with card machines, meaning payments are safe and secure.
