<p>Business Intelligence tools are used to retrieve this huge amount of data from different systems and give the end user an opportunity for analysis. The primary reason you need a point of sale for a restaurant is to accept cash and credit card payments. Multiple configurations as per the store requirement - I will explain with a simple example, say a retail chain wants to run a promotional offer only in one particular city, in such case, special configurations are required to be done for POS systems running in that city.</p>
<p>For old-school, on-premise systems, the cash register was the POS terminal. IPad devices provide a solution that helps eliminate order confusion, lagging service, and incomplete sales data.
