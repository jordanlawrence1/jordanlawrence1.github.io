<p>Restaurant POS software offers point of sale solutions specifically for the restaurant and bar industries. All sorts of payments are accepted: cash, credit, debit, check, gift card, and store credit. Its Brink POS software is designed for quick-service and fast casual eateries, and its PixelPoint POS is for full-service restaurants. This software includes table management and reservation management features as well as social media integration so you can easily send a Facebook invite or post to Twitter. Additionally, your bar menu needs to be friendly to the customers in your establishment.</p>
<p>Timely details about sales, inventory, invoicing, margins, orders and customers will help you earn more money than a new accounting system will save. Payment processors transmit payment information between relevant parties to complete transactions—information will be sent between your business' bank account and the paying customer's bank, for example, or between your acquiring bank and the customer's credit card issuer.</p>

We use livepos and this helps in simplifying our sales report every day and its accurate compared to the old fashioned cash registers.

<h3>Human Capital Management Godfrey Illinois</h3>
<p>In other words, your success depends on not only the type of dishes you're offering your customers, but also your restaurant management strategy. A great POS solution will not only improve your business, but it will also enhance the overall customer experience. The application is designed for ease of use, so you don't need vast technical background to navigate through the application and start processing sales orders, payments, and shipping.</p>
<p>Manage the tables across your restaurant to monitor which tables are occupied, which are not and how many customers are seated at each table. If you are planning a very small operation, such as bagel or sandwich shop, you may not need a POS system at the opening time, especially if you aren't going to take credit cards (and there are plenty of places that still don't accept plastic). With this feature, if your business receives a reminder to refill a stock of inventory, you'll simply have to press a few buttons within your POS to do so. Keep in mind that first you'll have to onboard your vendors into your POS system.</p>
<p>POS software in these cases handles special orders, purchase orders, repair orders, service and rental programs as well as typical point of sale functions. Lavu is an iPad POS system for restaurants, food trucks, coffee shops, bars, pizzerias and other eateries.
