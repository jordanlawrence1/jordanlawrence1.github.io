<p>POS systems come with a wide variety of features and add-ons. One thing you should note though- while you comfortable adopt it in a single-location business, TouchBistro's POS system is predominantly ideal for restaurant businesses with multiple locations. However, varying POS locations can give retailers more opportunities to micro-market specific product categories and influence consumers at earlier points in the sales funnel.</p>
<p>Perhaps a retail store uses touch technology when they check out a customer at the department store. The business owners only have to download an app and create an account for a mobile POS system.

<p>I know a lot of point of sale systems that look nice but run on an Access database, for small retail stores without any ambition of growing (I don't know anyone that see themselves in that light) this should be fine, but for the more ambitious entrepreneur (business person) I would recommend a SQL, My SQL etc. This way, you'll have happy customers increase your restaurant's popularity.

With a mobile POS system, on the other hand, they can split the check right at the table and, if there's any confusion as to who ordered what or how the table wants to divide a shared appetizer, the waiter is right there to ask the customers.</p>
