<p>It used to be that for a small retail business, a cash register and a black-box credit card terminal were sufficient. Before taking advantage of these long-term discounts, you should be confident that you like the software enough and will still be in business for that length of time, because there are usually no refunds. As with all POS systems, owners can track sales, deliveries, inventory, employee schedules, and payroll. Restaurants are one business that can truly take advantage of using hand held PCs for order placement.
